      Programming and Analysis program and is currently completing his second semester. He has many
      hobbies which include: Playing video games, Playing Soccer, Loves to watch Formula One and
      used to be a competitive Go Kart racer. Stefano started playing video games from a young age
      and was fascinated with the different types with different ranges of skill levels. His love
      for video games started when he used to watch his brothers play and would sit for hours
      studying their techniques and gameplay tactics. His favorite type of game genres would be
      strategy games which involves critical thinking and precise moves to outsmart his opponents.
      Games like: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_IV">Civilization IV</a> and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft">StarCraft</a> were games he would spend
      hours playing and developing skills. Soccer was a sport Stefano picked up later in his life
      and currently plays indoor leagues with his friends on the weekends. He found his love for
      soccer when his friends would talk about it while hanging out. Every sunday he would get
      together with his friends to play in an indoor 5v5 league and try to go for the season
      championships. His favorite team is the
      <a href="https://www.asroma.com/">A.S Roma Football Club</a> and watches every game they play.
      Formula One is something Stefano fell in love with ever since he was a young kid. Every
      weekend Stefano and his dad would watch the races and cheer on their favorite motorsport team
      <a href="https://www.ferrari.com/en-EN/formula1">Ferrari</a>. Stefano's favorite Formula One
      driver was
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a> and watched
      his reigning champion years from 2003-2004. Formula One was the reason Stefano started
      competitive karting from a young age built fundamental values like: consistency, precision and
      determination. The karts he drove were unbelievably fast and required 100% concentration and
      accuracy. Achieving speeds up to 140 km/h, Stefano had no room for error when operating these
      karts as making one mistake could be potentially dangerous. Overall Stefano is a creative,
      talented student that spends his days working on projects for schools, playing video games,
      and listen to music. He is always looking to challenge life with new opportunities to learn
      and grow, and will make a positive impact on whatever he works on.
