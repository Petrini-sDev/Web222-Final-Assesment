      <h3>What is BlackJack?</h3>
      <div class="first-line">
        <p class="first-paragraph">
          Blackjack is a famous card game that is guaranteed to be played in any Casino you step
          foot in. The goal of the game is to beat the dealer having a hand that is worth more
          points than the dealer without going over 21 and "busting". Sounds simple right? It's not
          as simple as you think. Each card has a value to it, 1-10 cards are worth the points that
          they are. ex: a 7 is worth 7 points etc. All of the face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings)
          are all worth 10 points. The ace is a special card, meaning it can be either a 1 or an 11
          depending on your current cards. At the start of the game, you and the dealer are given
          two cards, you are able to see both of your cards while you can only see the dealer's
          first card.

      <p class="second-paragraph">
        You are able to make four choices once those cards are dealt. Hit, Stand, Double down, and
        split. When you "Hit", you are given another card and you are able to hit or stand if you do
        not bust (go over 21). If you choose to stand, that means you are content with the cards you
        have and the turn passes to the dealer. Doubling down is an option that you can choose, but
        choose it wisely. If you choose to double down, you must make another bet of the same value
        and you are given only one card and that's it. Splitting is only an option if you are given
        two of the same cards or any 2 face cards. This means you must make another bet that's equal
        to your original bet and you treat those two cards separately as two different hands. You
        can still have the same 3 choices you get when playing a normal hand (Hit, Stand, Double
        down). The option of doubling down when you split varies from Casinos. If you beat the
        dealer in having more points or if the dealer busts, you are given a 1:1 payout. For
        example, If you bet $50 and win you will get $100 back. If you get a 10 or face card and an
        11, you get Blackjack. This means you get a better payout. Typically you will get either 3:2
        payouts or 6:5 payouts depending on how the Casino operates their blackjack tables. The ace
        operates as a 2 face card. It plays to the user's advantage meaning, if you have 1-10 on
        your first card, the ace will act as an 11. When you total cards add up to more than 10, the
        ace will then act as a one. To see more strategies refer to the
